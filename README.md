# Data_Analytics_2022
This is part of my submission for the Data Analytics course. My assigned task was to examine the
relationship between church appointments and population in England between 1500 - 1800. The
code covers:
1. Creation of a database containing church appointments in England between the years 1500
and 1800 by
(i) the scraping of webpages from the Clergy Database (https://theclergydatabase.org.uk/),
(ii) The extraction of data regarding church appointments from these webpages for the
location IDs [2,50000] and [235000, 250000],
(iii) The cleaning and creation of a final dataset from this data.
2. The creation of a balanced panel dataset by merging data on population separated into 25-
year panels and the earlier church data.
3. Analysis and prediction using this merged data.
Order in which to run files:
I. scraping_MB_modified.py
II. church.r
III. analysis.r
